# In class challenge

We can more formally find stablity by finding the system state when the derivative is zero


What if we have a slightly different forest management task -  to make harvest a fixed amount of  carbon but only take it if it is above a threshold minimum carbon

Think about how you would explore stability here

* create a new derivative function based on *dharvest.R*, but modify so that harvest is now a fixed value rather that a proportion of forest carbon

* assume a forest growth rate of 0.05, a carrying capacity of 1000kg and a harvest rate of 10kg/year

* can you figure out what the two stable values of forest carbon will be without running the ODE

# here's what I did

```{r stability}

source("../R/dharvestfixed.R")

# first lets look at how the derivative varies with the size of forest

carbon = seq(from=0, to=1000)
dcarbon= unlist(carbon %>% map(dharvestfixed,Time=NULL, parms=list(r=0.05, K=1000, mincarbon=0, harv=10)))

ggplot(as.data.frame(carbon,dcarbon), aes(carbon, dcarbon))+geom_point()+geom_hline(yintercept = 0, col="red")+
  labs(y="Derivative\n (Rate of change of forest carbon) (kg/C/year)", x="Current Forest Carbon Stock (kgC)")

# try it out with different initial conditions to watch how the system moves to a stable state
tm = seq(from=1, to=500)
Pinitial = 500
gps = list(harv=10, K=1000, r=0.05, mincarbon=0)

res = ode(Pinitial,tm, dharvestfixed, gps)
colnames(res)=c("time","carbon")

ggplot(as.data.frame(res), aes(time, carbon))+geom_point()+
   labs(y="Forest Biomass (kgC)", x="Year", title="Fixed Harvest of 10kg/year\n Starting conditions 500kgC")


#  try smaller starting condition
tm = seq(from=1, to=500)
Pinitial = 1
gps = list(harv=10, K=1000, r=0.05, mincarbon=0)

res = ode(Pinitial,tm, dharvestfixed, gps)
colnames(res)=c("time","carbon")

ggplot(as.data.frame(res), aes(time, carbon))+geom_point()+
   labs(y="Forest Biomass (kgC)", x="Year", title="Fixed Harvest of 10kg/year\n Starting conditions 1kgC")


#  try smaller starting condition
tm = seq(from=1, to=500)
Pinitial = 15
gps = list(harv=10, K=1000, r=0.05, mincarbon=0)

res = ode(Pinitial,tm, dharvestfixed, gps )
colnames(res)=c("time","carbon")

ggplot(as.data.frame(res), aes(time, carbon))+geom_point()+
   labs(y="Forest Biomass (kgC)", x="Year", title="Fixed Harvest of 10kg/year\n Starting conditions 1kgC")

# try a different method
res = ode(Pinitial,tm, dharvestfixed, gps, method="euler" )
colnames(res)=c("time","carbon")

ggplot(as.data.frame(res), aes(time, carbon))+geom_point()+
   labs(y="Forest Biomass (kgC)", x="Year", title="Fixed Harvest of 10kg/year\n Starting conditions 1kgC")
