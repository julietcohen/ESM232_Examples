sager = read.table("../Data/sager.txt", header=T)
head(sager)

# add date
sager = sager %>% mutate(date = paste(day,month,year, sep="/"))

# Measure Performance using different metrics

```{r}


source("../R/nse.R")

source("../R/relerr.R")


source("../R/cper.R")

nse
relerr
cper
nse(m=sager$model, o=sager$obs)

relerr(m=sager$model, o=sager$obs)*100

# Scale and subsetting

Performance also depends on the 'what' you are evaluating

  * time steps (annual, daily, monthly)
  
  * selection of particular periods of time
  
```{r}
# try a different time step
sager_wy = sager %>% group_by(wy) %>% summarize(model=sum(model), obs=sum(obs))

nse(sager_wy$model, sager_wy$obs)
cper(m=sager_wy$model, o=sager_wy$obs, weight.nse=0.8)

# just look at august flow
# first sum by month
tmp = sager %>% group_by(month, year) %>% summarize(model=sum(model), obs=sum(obs))

# now extract august
sager_aug = subset(tmp, month==8)
cor(sager_aug$model, sager_aug$obs)

# turn your evaluation metric into a function
source("../R/compute_lowflowmetrics.R")
compute_lowflowmetrics
compute_lowflowmetrics(m=sager$model,o=sager$obs, month=sager$month, day=sager$day, year=sager$year, wy=sager$wy)

# use different low flow months
compute_lowflowmetrics(m=sager$model,o=sager$obs, month=sager$month, day=sager$day, year=sager$year, wy=sager$wy, low_flow_months = c(7:9))


```
  

# try another metric

# create a combined metric
```{r}

perf = compute_lowflowmetrics(m=sager$model,o=sager$obs, month=sager$month, day=sager$day, year=sager$year, wy=sager$wy, low_flow_months = c(7:9))

perf = as.data.frame((perf))
# remember you want error to be low but correlation to be high 
# so we need to transform in some way

# normalize by max error = if error is greater than this we don't care
# many ideas -  maybe 50% of mean daily summer observed low flow
tmp = sager %>% subset(month %in% c(7:9)) 
errmax = mean(tmp$obs)*0.5

perf = perf %>% mutate(annual_min_err_trans = max(0,(1-abs(annual_min_err/errmax) )))
      
# for monthly we can do a simpler thing to find maximum allowable errror   
tmp = sager %>% subset(month %in% c(7:9)) %>% group_by(wy, month) %>% summarize(obs=sum(obs))

errmax = mean(tmp$obs)*0.5
 
perf = perf %>% mutate(low_month_err_trans = max(0,(1-abs(low_month_err/errmax) )))

# now we have 4 measures that we can combine together

perf = perf %>% mutate(combined = (annual_min_cor + annual_min_err_trans + low_month_err_trans + low_month_cor)/4)
perf
# or weight differently - we know that minimum flows are hard to get to weight those differently

perf = perf %>% mutate(combined2 = 0.1*annual_min_cor + 0.1*annual_min_err_trans + 0.4*low_month_err_trans+ 0.4*low_month_cor)

# easier to put all this in a function

# Calibration

Calibration is picking parameter sets based on performance evaluation

Apply metrics over multiple outputs (generated by running across many parameters sets) - like we've done in our sensitivity analysis work

Example - a dataset where each column
is a different model run for Sagehen Creek
(using different parameters) - don't worry about the parameters for now

* sagerm.txt



```{r multipel}

# multiple results - lets say we've run the model for multiple years, each column
# is streamflow for a different parameter set
msage = read.table("../Data/sagerm.txt", header=T)

# lets say we know the start date from our earlier output
msage$date = sager$date
head(msage)
msage$month = sager$month
msage$year = sager$year
msage$day = sager$day
msage$wy = sager$wy

# and we still have observed data from above


# how can we plot all results - lets plot water year 1970 otherwise its hard to see
msagel = msage %>% pivot_longer(cols=!c(date, month, year, day,wy), names_to="run", values_to="flow")

p1=ggplot(subset(msagel, wy == 1970), aes(as.Date(date), flow, col=run))+geom_line()+theme(legend.position = "none")
p1
# lets add observed streamflow
p1+geom_line(data=subset(sager, wy == 1970), aes(as.Date(date), obs), size=2, col="black", linetype=2)+labs(y="Streamflow", x="Date")


# compute performance measures for all output
res = msage %>% select(!c("date","month","year","day","wy")) %>%
      map_dbl(nse, o=sager$obs )

head(res)

# another example using our low flow statistics
# use apply to compute for all the data
# using the updated low flow metrics routing that also computed combined metrics

source("../R/compute_lowflowmetrics_all.R")
res = msage %>% select(-date, -month, -day, -year, -wy ) %>% map_df(compute_lowflowmetrics_all, o=sager$obs, month=msage$month, day=msage$day, year=msage$year, wy=msage$wy)


# interesting to look at range of metrics - could use this to decide on
# acceptable values
summary(res)


# graph range of performance measures
resl = res %>% pivot_longer(cols=everything(), names_to="metric", values_to="value")
ggplot(resl, aes(metric, value))+geom_boxplot()+facet_wrap(~metric, scales="free")

# try this
# assign an identifier to each row, use the same identify for columns of original streamflow data
# we can then use that to pick data
res$run = seq(from=1,to=nrow(res))
head(msage)
colnames(msage)=c(res$run, "date","month","year","day","wy")

# best one
best = res[which.max(res$combined),]
msagel  =  msage %>% pivot_longer(cols=!c(date, month, year, day,wy), names_to="run", values_to="flow")
ggplot(subset(msagel, run == best$run), aes(date, flow)) + geom_line()


# or show with all runs
# label runs for legends
# all just show 1970 so easy to see
msagel = msagel %>% mutate(best = ifelse(run==best$run, TRUE, FALSE))
ggplot(subset(msagel, wy==1970), aes(date, flow, col=best))+geom_line()

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
